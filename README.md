## Hello! 🐐
I'm Brooke! I'm a computer science student and creator of internet-related things. 

On GitHub, I've dabbled in:
- video game development and modding
- fullstack webdev
- system administration
- software development

I'm a big fan of goats! My favorite breeds include the [Nigerian Dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Dwarf_goat) and the [American Pygmy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pygmy).
